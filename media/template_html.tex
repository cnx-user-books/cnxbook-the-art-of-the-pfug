\section{Introduction}

This small template is designed to illustrate one way to embed hyperlinks
in your LaTeX document in a way that Connexions will readily translate.
This requires use of the \verb|html| package; you might need to download
\verb|html.sty| and supporting \verb|.sty| files.  
Details are addressed in Section~\ref{sec:download} below.
The popular alternative, \verb|hyperref.sty|, is not presently
supported by the LaTeX-to-Connexions translator.
Alternatively, you can embed links manually in Connexions once you
have imported your document.  You might well find this manual route 
to be rather simpler at present.

For general advice about LaTeX-to-Connexions translations, 
see the accompanying \htmladdnormallink{Connexions module}{http://cnx.org/content/m18243/latest/}. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Examples of hyperlinks}

The \verb|\htmladdnormallink| and \verb|\htmladdnormallinkfoot| commands
allow you to embed links in your LaTeX document.
For example, the command
\begin{verbatim}
 \htmladdnormallink{Rice website}{http://www.rice.edu}
\end{verbatim}
adds a link to the Rice university website.
The first argument to the command \verb|\htmladdnormallink| will be printed 
as text, whereas the second is the web address (URL) itself.
Thus, the command shown above displays as: \htmladdnormallink{Rice website}{http://www.rice.edu}.

In some cases you might like to also include the URL itself as the first argument,
to get a link such as
\begin{verbatim}
 \htmladdnormallink{http://www.rice.edu}{http://www.rice.edu}
\end{verbatim}
which displays as: \htmladdnormallink{http://www.rice.edu}{http://www.rice.edu}.
If you want the link to appear in the LaTeX document, the 
\verb|\htmladdnormallinkfoot| command adds the URL as a footnote.
For example,
\begin{verbatim}
 \htmladdnormallinkfoot{Rice website}{http://www.rice.edu}
\end{verbatim}
produces the output: \htmladdnormallinkfoot{Rice website}{http://www.rice.edu}.
The Connexions translator treats \verb|\htmladdnormallink|
and \verb|\htmladdnormallinkfoot| identically.

\subsection{A word of caution}
One must beware of one complication: if the URL contains characters
that have special meaning in LaTeX, then you can get run into frustrating errors.
For example, if you wish to link to the page \verb|http://cnx.org/join_form|,
the underscore can cause trouble.
\begin{verbatim}
 \htmladdnormallink{http://cnx.org/join_form}{http://cnx.org/join_form}  % error!
\end{verbatim}
will give an error due to the underscore in the \emph{first argument}.
(The underscore in the second argument, the link itself, is fine.)
You can get around this problem by simply using normal next for the first argument,
\begin{verbatim}
 \htmladdnormallink{Join Connexions}{http://cnx.org/join_form} 
\end{verbatim}
which appears as: \htmladdnormallink{Join Connexions}{http://cnx.org/join_form}.

Note that the footnote version,
\verb|htmladdnormallinkfoot|,
does not perform well for URLs that contain special characters.
For example,
\begin{verbatim}
 \htmladdnormallinkfoot{Join Connexions}{http://cnx.org/join_form}  % error!
\end{verbatim}
causes an error despite the absence of problematic characters in the first argument.

\section{Downloading the html.sty file} \label{sec:download}

In drafting this guide, we experimented with several versions of
\verb|html.sty|.  

First, we worked with version~95.1, which is available from, for example,
\htmladdnormallink{this link}{http://www.see.ed.ac.uk/~ltex/latex2e/html.sty}.
This version is easy to work with, but it does not actually embed clickable
links in your LaTeX output; the links will show up properly in the Connexions
translation. 

If you want clickable links in your LaTeX document as well as Connexions,
you will need a more recent version of \verb|html.sty|.  
We tested with version~1.39 (which, counterintuitively, is newer than
version~95.1).  You can download this version from 
\htmladdnormallink{this link}{http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~dommelen/l2hfu/notes/html.sty}.
This version requires a number of subordinate files that might not be included
in your LaTeX installation.  You can find most or all
of these packages in the \verb|oberdiek| bundle on the
 \emph{Comphensive TeX Archive Network} (CTAN); follow
\htmladdnormallink{this link}{http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/oberdiek}
and download the entire bundle.

Which version of \verb|html.sty| should you use?
Try version~1.39 first; if it fails, then start
downloading the missing packages, or just use version~95.1.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Preparing your LaTeX file for import}

When you create the \verb|.zip| file that contains your LaTeX source,
graphics, and bibliography files, be sure to include the \verb|html.sty|
file.  If this file is missing, the Connexions translator will fail to 
convert your file with minimal details about the error.
(Note that if you use \verb|html.sty| version~1.39, you do not need to 
include the subordinate \verb|.sty| files referred to in the previous section.)
