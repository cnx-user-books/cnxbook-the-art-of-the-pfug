  <md:title>Statistical Analysis of Cancer</md:title>
  <md:abstract>This report summarizes work done as part of the Bioinformatics PFUG under Rice University's VIGRE program.  VIGRE is a program of Vertically Integrated Grants for Research and Education in the Mathematical Sciences under the direction of the National Science Foundation.  A PFUG is a group of Postdocs, Faculty, Undergraduates and Graduate students formed round the study of a common problem.  This module describes various statistical analyses done to illuminate the causes of cancer.</md:abstract>

        <title>Central Dogma of Molecular Biology</title>
        <para id="id123018">It is important to understand the processes behind 
the genetic variables of interest. The most important concept is known as the 
central dogma of molecular biology. This describes that process of by which 
genetic information is interpreted and eventually proteins are created that are 
required for all life. We begin with double stranded DNA. DNA is composed of a 
long chain of two different base pairs (4 bases). The pairs are Adenine and 
Thymine, and Guanine and Cytosine. Thus at any point on the DNA strand you can 
have a choice of 4 different bases. Some sections of the DNA are genes. Each 
gene in the DNA is unzipped into one strand and then transcribed onto which is 
known as messenger RNA. The RNA can then be read and translated into protein. 
I.E. We progress as from DNA to mRNA to Protein.</para>

        <title>Copy Number and Gene Expression</title>
        <para id="id123375">Two genetic variables of interest that are involved 
in the central dogma are estimated copy number and gene expression. The 
estimated copy number of a gene gives the estimated number of copies of a 
specific gene exist with in a samples genome. Normally, we would expect to see a 
copy number of 2 but often we see copy numbers as low as 0 and as high as 5 or 
6. Most of the time this does not harm the particular patient and we expect to 
see a certain amount of copy number variation within any person, but it can 
sometimes be correlated with the incidence of cancer.</para>
        <para id="id123383">Gene expression is a variable that indicates the 
estimates amount of mRNA that one observes in a sample. It is often difficult to 
directly measure the amount of a given protein within a sample, but we often 
witness a correlation between the amount of mRNA in a sample and the amount of 
protein that is created.</para>

        <title>Goals</title>
        <para id="id123398">Our data is comprised of 89 samples which have 
estimated copy number data. 41 of these samples also have gene expression data. 
The goals of this project is to examine the copy number and gene expression data 
of these sample and see if there are certain sections in the genome that have 
are consistently over or under expressed and possibly have an abnormal copy 
number. The next steps would be to examine the known processes of these genes to 
see if they are incorporated in any cancer-related functions such as cell 
growth.</para>

      <title>Copy Number Analysis</title>
      <para id="id123415">First, the raw copy number data was imported into an 
application called Illumina Genome Studio. Physically, the data is obtained by 
measuring how bright a certain chemical fluoresces when mixed with the DNA. 
Genome Studio then estimates the copy numbers based on this data. Genome Studio 
was then used to generate a frequency plot which displays how frequently each 
gene was amplified or deleted,</para>
      <para id="id123435">In addition, to confirm our findings an R script was 
written that also generates a similar plot,</para>
      <para id="id123462">These findings were also confirmed using a program 
called GISTIC which is genetic analysis software which is part of the Broad 
Institutes Gene Pattern Server.</para>
      <para id="id123468">The next step in our analysis of the copy number data 
involved examining any genes that had extreme amplifications or extreme 
deletions. I.E. any genes in which the estimated copy number was less than .5 or 
greater than 5. A script was written in the R statistical package in order to 
detect the frequency with which the genes had major amplifications or deletions.

      <title>Future Work</title>
      <para id="id123538">The results of this research will be published in a 
future publication. It would be necessary to get more samples, especially ones 
with both copy number and gene expression data to create a full gene expression 
pattern. <link target-id="bid1"/></para>
